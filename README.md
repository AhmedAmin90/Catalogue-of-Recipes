# Catalogue of recipes:
 
> This is a react and redux capstone project in Microverse. I created a simple app as a catalogue of recipes. 

# In this application:
- The user can browse the catalog of recipes and cat select food categories that he likes.
- On every single page of the food the user will find the name, the image, and the ingredients of this recipe.

# Loading screen:
